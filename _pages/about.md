Hello, I am Antonios Kagias. I hold a degree from the Applied Informatics department of the Univeristy of Macedonia and have recently completed my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics in the same university. My master's thesis focused on the classification on multi-label data with ordered labels, specifically exploring scenarios where the importance of the labels is ordered. This academic journey has solidified my strong interest in the fields of data science and data analysis. I am a highly motivated individual who thrives in collaborative environments, and I pride myself on being a fast learner, always eager to acquire new skills and knowledge.
