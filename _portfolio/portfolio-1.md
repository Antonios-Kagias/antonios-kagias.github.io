The eshop is fully functional both for customers (front-end) and admin (back-end).  

Customers can browse through products depending on their type (smartphones, TVs etc.), add them or remove them from their cart and edit the cart by changing the quantity of products. They can also create an account for shopping or log in if they already have an account. Some default accounts have been created to test the functionality of the shop (log in, order history for each customer etc.).  

Admins can add or remove products, brands and categories of products. They can also see all the orders that have been made.
